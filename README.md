Odin Recipes is a student project that demonstrates basic html skills. Below you will find a reflection by the project author and credits.


**Reflection**

I did not understand why an image would load on my index page but not on the other pages. My linked pages just showd a broken image icon in the browser. It turned out that because my sub pages where in their own directory (pages), I needed to add '..' to my anchor links. This instructs the browser to search the directory one level up to find the images directory.

I spent some time learning to use the CLI to create a .gitignore file both locally and globally. I also learned how to add global .gitignore file to the git config file.

I learned the value of making a todo.md file. While researching other things, I saw this mentioned as a beneficial tool that developers use. I am aware that in many (most?) IDEs, there is a tool to create todo lists that point to specific lines of code. However, here is why a simple todo list is good:
1. It's simple.
2. If you write the todo items in the same way you would write a commit message, it makes the commit process easier (what did I do exactly)
3. It helps you work more efficiently and avoid rabbit holes

Why is markdown used widely by devs' to write task/todo lists? I'm not conclusively sure other than there are cool things you can do? :)
Oops... forgot to google it. [GitHub explains their reasons here](https://github.com/todomd/todo.md). Wow... the integration with GitHub flavored markdown is very versatile. One day I might explore that rabbit hole.

I am still not confident about how often to make commits. The general advice is commit everything. This can go too far, though, right?
commit: change font of headers
commit: resize taco image
commit: edit opening paragraph

... you get the idea. I suppose it becomes more obvious when working on more complex  projects?
